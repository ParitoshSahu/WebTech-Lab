        A world-renowned Indian dish, biryani takes time and practice to make but is worth every bit of the effort. 
        <br> Long-grained rice (like basmati) flavored with fragrant spices such as saffron and layered 
        <br> with lamb, chicken, fish, or vegetables and a thick gravy. The dish is then covered, its lid secured with dough, 
        <br> and then the biryani is cooked over a low flame. This is definitely a special occasion dish.
